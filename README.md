Is the usual mob spawning boring for you? You can make it like the entities are crawling out their graves.

This is the fully configurable plugin.
You can apply the unusual mob spawning for every entity in the config's whitelist.
Or apply it for all mobs and reduce mob types with the blacklist.

You can also change the spawn duration,
change the material for spawn particles,
change the mobs vulnerability while spawning,
enable or disable sounds while spawning and customize them!

You can use ProtocolLib for the best spawning for mobs with ridersâ€‹.
